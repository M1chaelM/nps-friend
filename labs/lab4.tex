\question Consider the following Post systems:

        \(\begin{array}[t]{l}
        a \in S

\end{tabbing}

        xx \in T
        \end{array}\)
\end{tabbing}

\end{multicols}
\begin{parts}
\part\label{ques:defSandT} Write definitions for $S$ and $T$ using set comprehension notation.
\begin{solution}
~\\
$S = \{a^k | k \in \Z^+\}$ (Note: $\Z^+$ refers to the positive integers.)\\
$T = \{a^{2^k} | k \in \N_0\}$ (Note: $\N_0$ refers to the non-negative
    integers.)\\
As discussed in class, there are many other ways of defining these sets. For
example, you could first define $\Sigma = \{a\}$, and then $S = \Sigma^+$.

\end{solution}
\part Is $S$ equal to $T$?
\begin{solution}
No.
\end{solution}
\part Bonus practice: Prove $T \subseteq S$.
\begin{solution}
\begin{proof}
We prove by weak induction on derivation height of
$T$ that all elements of $T$ can be derived in the system that defines $S$.\\
$S(0)$: If derivation height of an element $x \in T$ is $0$, then $x$ must have 
been produced using rule $B$. The only such element is $x = a$. However, $a$ can 
be derived immediately from the axiom of $S$, so $a \in S$.\\
$S(n)$: We assume that if the derivation height of an element in $T$ is $n$,
for $n \geq 0$, then $n \in S$.\\
$S(n+1)$: Let $y \in T$ such that the derivation height of $y$ is $n+1$. Then
$y$ is produced by rule $R$, and therefore has the form $y = x'x'$, where $x' \in T$
and $x'$ has derivation height $n$. By the inductive hypothesis, $x' \in S$. Using
rule $R$ in the Post system for $S$ and choosing $x'$ for both the $x$ and $y$ 
inputs, we have $xy = x'x' \in S$, which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

Further notes: In class, to practice proving the subset relation, we assumed that the
comprehensions given for $S$ and $T$ in question (\ref{ques:defSandT}) are 
correct, then showed that an arbitrary element of $T$ must also be in $x$.
The argument depends on how the sets have been described. Here is a proof
using this method with the definitions given above:
\begin{proof}
If $x \in T$ then $x = a^{2^k}$. Let $k' = 2^k$. Then $x = 2^{k'}$ and 
$k' \in \Z^+$ (since $k \in \N_0$), so $x \in T$.
\end{proof}
As mentioned in class, in order to make this rigorous one would
have to first prove that the set comprehensions given are a correct representation
of the sets defined by the Post systems.

\question Let $L$ be the number of leaf nodes and $I$ be the number
          of internal nodes. Suppose you are asked to prove that for all 
          full binary trees, $L = I + 1$.
\begin{parts}
\part What induction rule should you use? 
\begin{solution}
Strong mutual induction with multiple base cases.  
\end{solution}
\part What variable will you perform induction over? 
\begin{solution}
Derivation height.
\end{solution}
\part Set up the proof: write the base case, inductive hypothesis and inductive step.
\begin{solution}
~\\{\bf Base Cases:}\\
$S_1(0), S_1(1), S_1(2)$: If the derivation of $l\in \id{RTL}$ has height $0$,
  $1$ or $2$, then $L = I + |l|$.

$S_2(0), S_2(1), S_2(2)$: If the derivation of $t\in \id{RT}$ has height $0$,
  $1$ or $2$, then $L = I + 1$.

{ \bf Inductive Hypothesis:}\\
$S_1(k)$: If the derivation of $l\in \id{RTL}$ has height $k$ where $2 \leq k
\leq n$ and $n \geq 0$, then $L = I + |l|$.

$S_2(k)$: If the derivation of $t\in \id{RT}$ has height $k$ where $2 \leq k
\leq n$ and $n \geq 0$, then $L = I + 1$.

{\bf Inductive Step:}\\
$S_1(n+1)$: Assuming the inductive hypothesis, we must show if the derivation of $l\in \id{RTL}$ 
            has height $n+1$ then $L = I + |l|$.

$S_2(n+1)$: Assuming the inductive hypothesis, we must show if the derivation of $t\in \id{RT}$ 
            has height $n+ 1$ then $L = I + 1$.


\end{solution}
\part Prove the base case.
\begin{solution}
%omitted
~\\
$S_1(0)$: If the derivation of $l\in \id{RTL}$ has height $0$, it was
produced by rule $B$. Therefore, it is the empty list, so $L = I = |l| = 0$,
and $ 0 = 0 + 0$, so the formula holds.

$S_2(0)$: There is no $t\in \id{RT}$ with a derivation height of $0$. Therefore
this statement is vacuously true. 

$S_1(1)$: If the derivation of $l\in \id{RTL}$ has height $1$, then it was
produced by rule $R1$. However, this implies that it has the form $cons(t,u)$
where the derivation height of $t,u \in RT$ is $0$. Since no elements of $RT$
have a derivation height of $0$, this is false, so the implication is vacuously
true.

$S_2(1)$: If $t\in \id{RT}$ has a derivation height of $1$, it has the form
$node(l)$ where $l \in RTL$ has a derivation height of $0$. Therefore
$l$ was produced by rule $B$, so $l$ is the empty list, and the tree $t$ is a
single root. The root $t$ has no children, so it is a leaf, and $t$ has no
internal nodes. Therefore subsituting into $L = I + 1$ gives $1 = 0 + 1$,
and the formula holds.

$S_1(2)$: If the derivation of $l\in \id{RTL}$ has height $2$, then it was
produced by rule $R1$. This implies that it has the form $cons(t,u)$
where the derivation height of $t,u \in RT$ is $1$. Therefore both $t$ and $u$
have the form $node(l')$ where $l'$ has a derivation height of $0$, and is
therefore the empty list. Consequently, both $t$
and $u$ are single node trees, and both have a single leaf and no internal
nodes. It follows that $l$ has $2$ leaf nodes and $0$ internal nodes, so
substituting for the formula $L = I + |l|$ gives $2 = 0 + 2$, which is correct.

$S_2(2)$: If $t\in \id{RT}$ has a derivation height of $2$, it has the form
$node(l)$ where $l \in RTL$ has a derivation height of $1$. However, this
implies $l$ has the form $cons(t,u)$, where $t$ and $u$ have a derivation
height of $0$, which is impossible, since there is no axiom that produces
elements of $RT$. Therefore the premise is false, and the implication
is vacuously true.
%
\end{solution}
\part Prove the inductive step.
\begin{solution}
%omitted
\begin{proof}
$S_1(n+1)$: If the derivation of $l'\in \id{RTL}$ has height $n+1$ then it was
produced by rule $R1$ so it has the form $ l' = cons(t,u)$, where $t$ and $u$ are
in $RT$ and have derivation height $k$, where $2 \geq k \geq n$. Let $L$ be the
number of leaf nodes in $l'$, $L_t$ be the number of leaf nodes in $t$ and $L_u$ 
be the number of leaf nodes in $u$. Similarly, let $I, I_t,I_u$ represent the
number of internal nodes in $l',t,u$, respectively. Clearly, $L' = L_t + L_u$
and $I = I_t + I_u$. Moreover, by the inductive hypothesis $S_2$, we have 
$L_t = I_t + 1$ and $L_u = I_u + 1$. Thus, $L =  L_t + L_u = I_t + 1 + I_u + 1 =
I_t + I_u + |l'| = I + |l'|$. This proves $S_1(k) \land S_2(k) \implies S_1(n+1)$
where $2 \leq k \leq n$.

$S_2(n+1)$: All elements of $\id{RT}$ are produced by $R2$ so if $t' \in RT$
and $t'$ has a derivation height of $n+ 1$ then it has the form $node(l)$, where 
$l \in RTL$ and $l$ has a derivation height of $n$. Since $2 \leq k \leq n$, 
$n$ is a possible value of $k$ and the inductive hypothesis applies.  Let $L, I$ 
be the number of leaf nodes and internal nodes in $t'$, respectively, and 
let $L_l,I_l$ be the number of leaf nodes and internal nodes in $l$. Since the 
derivation height of $l$ is at least $2$ it must have been produced by
rule $R1$. Therefore $|l| = 2$ and $l = cons(t,u)$, where $t$ and $u$ have
derivation heights of at least $1$ (and thus contain at least one node).
It follows that $L = L_l$, since the process of forming a tree with $node$ 
does not add any more leaves, and $I = I_l + 1$, since forming a tree from 
the trees in $l$ produces one extra internal node (the new root). By the 
inductive hypothesis, we have that $L_l = I_l + |l|$, so by substitution 
$L = I_l + |l|$. Moreover, because $|l| = 2$, $L = I_l + |l| = I_l + 1 + 1 = I +
1$. This proves $S_1(k) \land S_2(k) \implies S_2(n+1)$ where $2 \leq k \leq n$.
\end{proof}
\end{solution}

\uplevel{\section*{Simple Automata}}
\question The diagram below shows a slightly modified version of the simple
switch discussed in class. \\
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.5in, height=.75in,keepaspectratio=true]{evenzeroautomata.eps}
\label{2sp}
\end{figure}

There are two changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Instead of a button labeled ``Push,'' this machine has a single button
labeled ``0''. Pressing the button represents sending the character ``0''
to the machine, which results in a state transition, just as it did when labeled
``Push'' in the previous version.
\item The double circle shown for the start state indicates that this is an
``accepting'' state. If the machine is in an accepting state after processing
all its input, it has accepted the input. If it ends in any other state, it has
rejected the input.
\end{itemize}
For the following questions, let $L$ be the set of all strings accepted by this machine. 
We refer to this set as the language recognized by the machine.

\begin{parts}
\part What is the alphabet of $L$?
\begin{solution}
$\{0\}$
\end{solution}
\part\label{ques:defL} Define $L$ using set comprehension notation. 
\begin{solution}
$L = \{0^{2k} | k \in \N_0\}$
\end{solution}

\part\label{ques:completeness} What induction rule would you use to prove that 
all the strings contained in the set $L$ as you have defined it are accepted by 
the machine? What variable should you do induction over?
\begin{solution}
Weak induction on $k$ (see definition of $L$ given in (\ref{ques:defL})). Note that 
answers may vary---in particular, you could also use strong induction on the length 
of an even-length string of $0$s.
\end{solution}
\part\label{ques:soundness} What induction rule would you use to prove that all the 
strings accepted by the machine are contained in the set $L$ as you have defined it? What
variable should you do induction over?
\begin{solution}
Mutual weak induction on input length.
\end{solution}
\part Which of the above proves soundness of the machine with respect to $L$, and 
which proves completeness? 
\begin{solution}
(\ref{ques:soundness}) proves soundness of the set of strings the machine accepts 
(i.e., it \emph{only} accepts strings of even length).
(\ref{ques:completeness}) proves completeness of the set of strings the machine
accepts (i.e., it accepts \emph{all} strings of even length).
\end{solution}
\part Sketch the proof of completeness.
\begin{solution}
Let $x$ be an even length string of $0$s. Then $x$ has the form $x = 0^{2k}$,
  where $k \in N_0$. We prove by weak induction on $k$ that the automaton
  accepts all strings of this form.\\
{\bf $S(0)$ (the base case):} the automaton accepts the string $x = 0^{2\cdot 0}$.\\ 
{\bf  $S(k)$ (the inductive hypothesis):} the automaton accepts
  strings of the form $0^{2k}$, for $k \geq 0$.\\
{\bf $S(k + 1)$ (the inductive step):} We must show that the inductive hypothesis
  implies that the automaton accepts strings of the form $0^{2(k+1)}$.
\end{solution}
 
\part Prove the base case.
\begin{solution}
$S(0)$: $x = 2^0 = \epsilon$. The automata starts in an accepting state. Since
the input is the empty string, no transitions are made, so the automaton ends
in an accepting state.
\end{solution}
\part Prove the inductive step.
\begin{solution}
We must show that the automaton accepts the string $y$ where $y = 0^{2(k+1)}$.
By definition of the concatenation operation, we can rewrite $y$ as $x00$,
where $x = 0^{2k}$. We know by the inductive hypothesis that the automaton 
accepts strings of the form $0^{2k}$, for $k \geq 0$, so it will be in an
accepting state after consuming the characters of $x$. Then, by the state
diagram, consuming the two remaining $0$ characters will cause the automaton
to transition first to the non-accepting state (on the first $0$) and then
back to the accepting state (on the second $0$). Since these are the only
possible transitions, the automaton must be in an accepting state after
consuming the entire string $y$. This proves the inductive step.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}
\end{questions}
