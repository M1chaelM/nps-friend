{\bf Theorem}. $n\in S$ iff $n$ is a positive multiple of 3.
\vspace{1em}

{\bf Proof}.  As the statement is an ``iff'', it has two parts, the ``only-if'' part (soundness)
and the ``if'' part (completeness).

\vspace{1em} 
(only-if): $n\in S$ only if $n$ is a positive multiple of 3.

\vspace{1em} 
(if): if $n$ is a positive multiple of 3 then $n\in S$. 
\end{wideslide}


\begin{wideslide}[bm=,toc=]{Soundness by strong induction}
(only-if): $n\in S$ only if $n$ is a positive multiple of 3.
This is proved by strong induction on the height of the derivation of $n\in S$.

\vspace{1em}
$S(k)$: if the derivation of $n\in S$ has height $k$ then $n$ is a positive multiple of 3.

\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}[t]{l}
S(0) \\
\forall k\geq 0.\, S(0)\wedge \cdots \wedge S(k)\Rightarrow S(k+1) \\
\hline
\forall k\geq 0.\, S(k)
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}

\vspace{1em}
Basis: Show $S(0)$.

\vspace{1em}
Inductive hypothesis: Suppose $S(0),\ldots ,S(k)$ {\bf where} $k\geq 0$.

\vspace{1em}
Inductive step: Show $S(k+1)$.
\end{wideslide}

\begin{wideslide}[bm=,toc=]{Soundness: basis and inductive step}
{\em $S(0)$\/}: derivation height is zero. \\ 
Then the derivation must end with an
application of rule {\bf B}, which implies $n=3$.
And 3 is a positive multiple of 3 since $3\cdot 1=3$.

\vspace{1em}
{\em $S(k + 1)$}.
We must show $n$ is a positive multiple of 3 if $n\in S$ has derivation height $k+1$ and $k\geq 0$.

\vspace{1em}
Suppose $n\in S$ has derivation height $k+1$ and $k\geq 0$.
Then since $k\geq 0$, the derivation must end with an application of rule {\bf R}.
Thus $n$ can be expressed as the sum of $i$ and $j$ where $i\in S$ and $j\in S$.
By induction, $i$ and $j$ are positive multiples of $3$, meaning there are positive integers
$a$ and $b$ such that $i=3a$ and $j=3b$.
Hence 
\[n = i + j = 3a + 3b = 3(a+b)
\]
thus establishing $n$ is a positive multiple of 3.
\end{wideslide}

\begin{wideslide}[bm=,toc=]{Completeness by weak induction}
(if): if $n$ is a positive multiple of 3 then $n\in S$.
All positive multiples of 3 can be expressed as $3k$ for some positive integer $k$.
We prove by {\em weak induction\/} on $k \in \N$ that $3k\in S$.


\vspace{1em}
$S(k)$: if $k$ is a positive integer such that $k\geq 1$ then $3k\in S$.

\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}[t]{l}
S(1) \\
\forall k\geq 1.\, S(k)\Rightarrow S(k+1) \\
\hline
\forall k\geq 1.\, S(k)
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}

\vspace{1em}
Basis: Show $S(1)$.

\vspace{1em}
Inductive hypothesis: Suppose $S(k)$ {\bf where} $k\geq 1$.

\vspace{1em} 
Inductive step: Show $S(k+1)$.
\end{wideslide}

\begin{wideslide}[bm=,toc=]{Completeness by weak induction}
{\em $S(1)$\/}: $k=1$.\\  
\vspace{1em}
By axiom {\bf B}, $3\in S$ so $3k\in S$ since $3k = 3$.

\vspace{2em}
{\em $S(k + 1)$}:
We must show $3(k+1)\in S$ where $k\geq 1$.\\
\vspace{1em}
We have $3(k+1) = 3k + 3$.
By induction, $3k\in S$ and by axiom {\bf B}, $3\in S$.
Therefore by rule {\bf R}, $3k + 3\in S$, or $3(k+1)\in S$.

\begin{wideslide}[bm=,toc=]{Completeness by strong induction}
If $n$ is a positive integer such that $n\geq 12$ then $n\in P$.

\vspace{1em}
The proof is by strong induction on $n$.
Suppose $n\geq 12$.

\vspace{1em}
{\em Basis\/}: There are four cases: $n=12$, $n=13$, $n=14$ and $n=15$.

\vspace{1em}
$12\in P$ by 3 applications of rule {\bf B1} and two applications of {\bf R}.

$13\in P$ by 2 applications of {\bf B1}, one application of {\bf B2} and two applications of {\bf R}.

$14\in P$ by 2 applications of {\bf B2}, one application of {\bf B1} and two applications of {\bf R}.

$15\in P$ by 3 applications of {\bf B2} and two applications of {\bf R}.

\vspace{1em}
{\em Inductive hypothesis\/}:  Suppose $n\geq 15$ and $k\in P$ if $12\leq k \leq n$.

\vspace{1em}
{\em Inductive step}.
We must show $n+1\in P$ where $n\geq 15$.
Since $n\geq 15$, $n+1-4\geq 12$.
By induction, $n-3\in P$.
By axiom {\bf B1}, $4\in P$.
So by rule {\bf R} $n-3+4\in P$ or $n+1\in P$.
